        <p>Compass is a site designed to give you resources to help with your anxiety,
          whether thatâ€™s by timing your breathing in the stim page or getting tips from the resources page.</p>
        <img class = "image" src="images/girls who code pic.jpg">
        <p>We decided to make Compass as a final project for the Girls Who Code summer immersion program
             because so many people need help coping with their anxiety.</p>
          <p>Throughout our final project, we learned important skills, including communication and teamwork.</p>
