# Compass
Compass is a site designed to give you resources to help with your anxiety, whether thatâ€™s by timing your breathing in the stim page or getting tips from the resources page.

We decided to make Compass as a final project for the Girls Who Code summer immersion program because so many people need help coping with their anxiety.

Throughout our final project, we learned important skills, including communication and teamwork.
